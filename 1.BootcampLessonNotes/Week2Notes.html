        <h3 class="mt-1 text-lg mb-1 font-semibold text-gray-900">Tailwind Setup and Activation</h3>
            <ul class="mx-6 list-disc">
                <li>The first things to note are: Make sure you have the necessary links included in the header
                    of your .html file to link to your up Tailwind stylesheets, and make sure you run any commands 
                    necessary to activate your Tailwind watching/updating. </li>
                    <ul class="mx-12 list-decimal">
                        <li> &nbsp; &nbsp;  Links in Header of .html file</li>
                        <li> &nbsp; &nbsp;  Configure content: add file path to tailwin.config.js file</li>
                        <li> &nbsp; &nbsp;  May or may not need to run the npx command in the terminal for the highest parent folder: "npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input_styles.css -o ./1.BootcampLessonNotes/output_styles.css --watch"</li>
                        <li> &nbsp; &nbsp;  Have a terminal open to make sure that it is regularly "Rebuilding"</li>
                        <li> &nbsp; &nbsp;  Note: All file paths to the Tailwind CSS is similar for the Notes pages, pay attention to file structure.
                            It seems there aren't any issues in linking to the same output css file from multiple HTML files.  </li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="mt-1 italic">Creating and Styling Lists</h4>
                <ul class="mx-6 list-disc">
                    <li>List items must have enough margin on the x-axis for the bullet point to show up. I often use 
                        <span class="bg-gray-200 px-2 rounded-sm text-gray-900 font-mono text-sm">mx-6</span>.</li>
                    <li>List items must be held within a <span class="bg-gray-200 px-2 rounded-sm text-gray-900 font-mono text-sm">&lt;ul&gt;</span> element. 
                    This element is where we can specify the margin and list-style classes.</li>
                    <li>Writing a simple <span class="bg-gray-200 px-2 rounded-sm text-gray-900 font-mono text-sm">&lt;p&gt;</span>
                    element and specifying class as <span class="bg-gray-200 px-2 rounded-sm text-gray-900 font-mono text-sm">list-disc</span>
                    won't create a list.</li>
                </ul>
            <h4 class="mt-1 italic">Writing Literal Code</h4>
                <ul class="mx-6 list-disc">
                    <li>Writing literal code has some similarities, and some differences when styling with Tailwind. 
                        For including symbols, we can still use the "&amp;lt;" and "&amp;gt;" for the brackets, but the styling 
                        is not done using a <span class="bg-gray-200 px-2 rounded-sm text-gray-900 font-mono text-sm">&lt;code&gt;</span> element,
                        it is done with custom Tailwind class styling. See this .html file for this style. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
    
    <h2 class="mt-2 text-xl mb-2 font-bold text-gray-900">Lesson Notes</h2>
        <h3 class="mt-1 text-lg mb-1 font-semibold text-gray-900"> 2.1) Intro</h3>
            <ul class="mx-6 list-disc">
                <li>In the first introductory week of the Bootcamp we’ve learned the basics of creating HTML pages and styling them 
                    with Tailwind. We also learned how to publish a static HTML page on Netlify.The term 'static' here is in contrast 
                    with 'dynamic'. Dynamic pages are typically generated with the use of a database, and get their final state
                    different depending on some data that changes. </li>
            </ul>
        <h3 class="mt-1 text-lg mb-1 font-semibold text-gray-900"> 2.2) Introducing Astro</h3>
            <ul class="mx-6 list-disc">
                <li>Astro is a "modern static site builder". it makes things very easy to work with HTML and Tailwind, and to have things with a proper 
                    structure right from the start. </li>
                <li>And by implementing it you start working with your first development tool, which is something you’ll get used to all the time. 
                    As developers, one of our tasks is to always try new tools.</li>
                <li>Astro is a <span class="italic font-semibold">tiny abstraction</span> over the HTML files we used in the last week when we wrote HTML in a .html file.</li>
                    <div>
                        <p class="ml-6 italic text-sm">See the Mozilla definition of "abstraction" 
                            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Abstraction" class="text-blue-600 font-semibold">here</a>.</p>
                        <p class="ml-6 italic text-sm">Stackify article and example of abstraction <a href="https://stackify.com/oop-concept-abstraction/" class="text-blue-600 font-semibold">here</a>. </p>
                        <p class="ml-12 italic text-sm"> <span class="text-lg font-bold">"</span>I’m a coffee addict. So, when I wake up in the morning, I go into my kitchen, switch on the coffee machine and make coffee. 
                            Sounds familiar? Making coffee with a coffee machine is a good example of abstraction. You need to know how to use your 
                            coffee machine to make coffee. You need to provide water and coffee beans, switch it on and select the kind of coffee you 
                            want to get. The thing you don’t need to know is how the coffee machine is working internally to brew a fresh cup of 
                            delicious coffee. You don’t need to know the ideal temperature of the water or the amount of ground coffee you need to use.
                            Someone else worried about that and created a coffee machine that now acts as an abstraction and hides all these details. 
                            You just interact with a simple interface that doesn’t require any knowledge about the internal implementation.
                            You can use the same concept in object-oriented programming languages like Java.<span class="text-lg font-bold">"</span></p>
                    </div>
                <li>What we’ll do in Astro is, we’ll just write the same HTML but we’ll create 
                    <span class="bg-gray-200 px-2 rounded-sm text-pink-700 font-mono text-sm">.astro</span> files intead of 
                    <span class="bg-gray-200 px-2 rounded-sm text-pink-700 font-mono text-sm">.html</span> pages. </li>
                <li class="italic font-semibold">That’s it (to start with). Just a file extension change. </li>
                <li>In this project we’ll write multiple HTML pages in Astro. But before we can install Astro, we must install 
                    Node.js because we need to use the npm command line tool.</li>
            </ul>
        <h3 class="mt-1 text-lg mb-1 font-semibold text-gray-900"> 2.3) Install Note.js On Your Computer</h3>
            <ul class="mx-6 list-disc">
                <li>Node.js is the way we can run JavaScript *outside of the browser*, so we can use all the fantastic tools that 
                    are built on top of JavaScript that make our life easier as developers. Like, for example, running Astro, 
                    Next.js, React, and much more.</li>
                <li>I have already installed Node, so nothing needed to be done here. </li>
            </ul>
        <h3 class="mt-1 text-lg mb-1 font-semibold text-gray-900"> 2.4) Set up and Astro Project and create a Git repository</h3>
            <h4 class="mt-1 italic">Node.js</h4>
                <ul class="mx-6 list-disc">
                    <li>Now that you have Node.js installed, you have access, among others, to the
                        <span class="bg-gray-200 px-2 rounded-sm text-gray-900 font-mono text-sm">node</span> and 
                        <span class="bg-gray-200 px-2 rounded-sm text-gray-900 font-mono text-sm">npm</span> commands. </li>
                    <li><span class="bg-gray-200 px-2 rounded-sm text-gray-900 font-mono text-sm">node</span> lets you 
                        run Javascript files.</li>
                    <li>You can type <span class="bg-gray-200 px-2 rounded-sm text-gray-900 font-mono text-sm">node file.js</span>
                        and the JavaScript contained in the 
                        <span class="bg-gray-200 px-2 rounded-sm text-pink-700 font-mono text-sm">file.js</span>
                        file will be executed. </li>
                    <li><span class="bg-gray-200 px-2 rounded-sm text-gray-900 font-mono text-sm">npm</span> is a utility program
                        that is used to mainly do 3 things: 
                        <ul class="mx-12 list-decimal">
                            <li>Initialize a project using <span class="bg-gray-200 px-2 rounded-sm text-gray-900 font-mono text-sm">npm init <...></span> </li>
                            <li>Download and install Javascript packages, and add them to your project using
                                <span class="bg-gray-200 px-2 rounded-sm text-gray-900 font-mono text-sm">npm install <...></span>
                            </li>
                            <li>Run a project using <span class="bg-gray-200 px-2 rounded-sm text-gray-900 font-mono text-sm">npm run <...></span></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>You’ll use this command all the time. Especially you’ll use 
                        <span class="bg-gray-200 px-2 rounded-sm text-gray-900 font-mono text-sm">npm run dev</span> a lot, which 
                        is the command we use to run tools like Astro or Next.js locally, for development. </li>
                </ul>
